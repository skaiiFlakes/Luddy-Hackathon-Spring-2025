Based on the provided job description and resume, please create a list of 10 questions for a technical interview of the candidate. They should be formatted as a JSON array of strings in roughly ascending order of difficulty.

For example:

* If the job requires knowledge of data mining, you should ask questions like "Explain what overfitting is" or "How does backpropagation work?"
* If the job requires knowledge of systems programming, you should ask questions like "Explain what a register is" or "How does TCP work?"
* You may choose to start with some generic "softball" questions, such as asking the candidate to introduce themselves or explain what attracted them to the position.
* Do not include framing (such as greeting the candidate.) Only write the question and nothing more.
