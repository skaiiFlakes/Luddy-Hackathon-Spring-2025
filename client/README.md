This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Running with Docker

To run the application using Docker and `docker-compose.yml`, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
2. Build and start the Docker containers using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the frontend.
4. The backend service will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
